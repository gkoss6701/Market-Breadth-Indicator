"""
Pulls the most recent trading day's OHLCV for the universe and upserts into
the prices table. Run via .github/workflows/daily_ingest.yml.

NOTE: swap `fetch_bulk_ohlcv` for a Polygon/Tiingo bulk-endpoint client
once you outgrow yfinance's reliability at full S&P 500 scale -- the
downstream schema/engine code doesn't need to change.
